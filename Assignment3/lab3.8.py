'''
Aim
Write a simple nested loop example that sums the even and odd numbers between 5 and 15 and prints out the computation.

Steps for Completion
Write a for loop with a range function for even numbers.

Write a for loop with a range function for odd numbers.

Use a variable called calc to calculate the sum of even and odd numbers.

Print the computation of each even number plus the odd number equal to calc to the terminal.

The output will be as shown in Snippet 3.58:

6 + 5 = 11
6 + 7 = 13
6 + 9 = 15
6 + 11 = 17
6 + 13 = 19
8 + 5 = 13
8 + 7 = 15
8 + 9 = 17
8 + 11 = 19
8 + 13 = 21
10 + 5 = 15
10 + 7 = 17
10 + 9 = 19
10 + 11 = 21
10 + 13 = 23
12 + 5 = 17
12 + 7 = 19
12 + 9 = 21
12 + 11 = 23
12 + 13 = 25
14 + 5 = 19
14 + 7 = 21
14 + 9 = 23
14 + 11 = 25
14 + 13 = 27
